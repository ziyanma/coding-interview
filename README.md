# James Ma's Practical Guide to Coding Interview

# FORWARD
In this guide, I am trying to provide my insights as both an interviewer who has conducted more than 200 interviews, as well as a candidate, who has went through over 100 coding interviews. I want to provide a simple and practical study guide for candidates with limited time, to be able to improve their skills at coding interview.

You might ask: there are leetcode, why is this book still necessary? Why can't I spend the same time reading this book, trying to solve problems on leetcode?

Well, at the moment of writing this book, there are north of 3000 interview questions on leetcode. A candidate with a full-time job simply cannot brute-force all the questions. And, knowing a solution to a question, does NOT mean you pass the interview automatically. Sarcastically, one of the only times I actually encountered a question that I solved before on leetcode, I forgot the solution. I went on to a painful time trying to recall the solution and reasoning, spending a long time coding, and persumably got a weak hiring signal. 

I did pass the interview, though it was by far not the best I was able to do.

In this guide, I am trying my best to answer the following questions with some examples:
- What is an interviewer looking for?
- How does interviewer score your interview?
- What a strong hire, weak hire, or no-hire looks like?
- How to increase your score?
- How to efficiently improve your interview skills?
- How to write efficient and practical code in a coding interview?


In this guide, I am not going to do:
- Iterate through every algorithm & data structure that you would need in your interviews.
- Go over insane optimization to beat 100% of leetcode solution (xd).
- Test you on the hardest question you ever seen.
- Discuss anything beyond the scope of coding interview. (Behavior, System Design etc.).

This is probably enough yapping for now, so let's start to have some fun :)
